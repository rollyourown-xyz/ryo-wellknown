# Roll Your Own Well-known URI Server

Deploy a well-known URI server using Ansible, Packer and Terraform.

## Module Summary

This module uses [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/), [Packer](https://www.packer.io/) and [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) to deploy an [nginx](https://nginx.org/) webserver to respond to [well-known URIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_URI), as a module for other [rollyourown.xyz projects](https://rollyourown.xyz/rollyourown/projects/).

## How to Use

A [rollyourown.xyz](https://rollyourown.xyz/) module contains automation code to configure, build, deploy, maintain, back up and restore a module for use by other rollyourown.xyz projects.

In itself, a module doesnâ€™t provide a full end-to-end service, but rather provides a reusable building block that is used in a full rollyourown.xyz project as part of the end-to-end solution for that project.

A detailed description for project developers of how to use this module in a project can be found in the [module's documentation](https://rollyourown.xyz/rollyourown/project_modules/ryo-wellknown/).
